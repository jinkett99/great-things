They \nwere the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything \nstrange or mysterious, because they  just didn\u2019t hold with such \nnonsense. \nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which \nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, \nalthough he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was \nthin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, \nwhich came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning \nover garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a \nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \nboy anywhere. \nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a \nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover \nit. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about \nthe Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Durs ley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t \nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t \nhave a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband \nwere as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys \nshuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters \narrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was \nanother good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t \nwant Dudley mixing with a child like that. \nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday \nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to \nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be hap-\npening all over the country.

He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s \ndrive. \nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign  \nof something peculiar \u2013 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr \nDursley didn\u2019t realise what he had seen \u2013 then he jerked his head \naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \nof Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could  \nhe have been thinking of? It must  have been a trick of the light. \nMr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr \nDursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the \ncat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \n\u2013 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr \nDursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his  \nmind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a \nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \nBut on the edge of town, drills we re driven out of his mind by \nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he \ncouldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely \ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn\u2019t bear \npeople who dressed in funny clothes \u2013 the get-ups you saw on \nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He \ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a \nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-\npering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a \ncouple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older \nthan he was, and wearing an em erald-green cloak! The nerve of \nhim! But then it struck Mr Durs ley that this was probably some \nsilly stunt \u2013 these people were obviously collecting for something \n\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes \nlater, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind  \nback on drills. \nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office \non the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to \nconcentrate on drills that morning.

He made several important \ntelephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \nmood until lunch-time, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs  \nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker\u2019s \nopposite. \nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a \ng r o u p  o f  t h e m  n e x t  t o  t h e  b a k e r \u2019 s .

Ten years ago, there \nhad been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \nball wearing different-coloured bobble hats \u2013 but Dudley Dursley \nwas no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large, \nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair, \nplaying a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed \nby his mother.

Harry had a thin face, knobbly \nknees, black hair and bright-green eyes. He wore round glasses \nheld together with a lot of Se llotape because of all the times \nDudley had punched him on the nose.

A wizard? Him? How \ncould he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley \nand bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a \nwizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time \nthey\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the \ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been \nable to kick him around like a football? \n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018I think you must have made a mistake. \nI don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u2019 \nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \n\u2018Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was \nscared, or angry?\u2019 \nHarry looked into the fire. No w he came to think about it \u2026 \nevery odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious \nwith him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry \n\u2026 chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of \ntheir reach \u2026 dreading going to school with that ridiculous hair-\ncut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back \u2026 and the very last time \nDudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even real-\nising he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him? \nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was \npositively beaming at him. \n\u2018See?\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Harry Potter, not a wizard \u2013 you wait, you\u2019ll \nbe right famous at Hogwarts.\u2019 \nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight. \n\u2018Haven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u2019 he hissed. \u2018He\u2019s going to \nStonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters \nand he needs all sorts of rubbish \u2013 spell books and wands and \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u2019 \ngrowled Hagrid. \u2018Stop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter \nHogwarts!

Harry, who had expected \nmore marble, was surprised. They  were in a narrow stone passage-\nway lit with flaming torches.

They \nclimbed in \u2013 Hagrid with some difficulty \u2013 and were off. \nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. \nHarry tried to remember, left, right,  right, left, middle fork, right, \nleft, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its \nown way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering. \nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept \nthem wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end \nof a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \n\u2013 they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where \nhuge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \n\u2018I never know,\u2019 Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \n\u2018what\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u2019 \n\u2018Stalagmite\u2019s got an \u201cm\u201d in it,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018An\u2019 don\u2019 ask me \nquestions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u2019 \nHe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside \na small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean \nagainst the wall to stop his knees trembling. \nGriphook unlocked the door.

He had \ndecided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of \nMagic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed \nreading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t \ncome in to hoover any more, because Hedwig kept bringing back \ndead mice.

Best wizard in the world! \nBut he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u2019 \nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now \npiled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat \non one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb \nchops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \nchips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup and, for \nsome strange reason, mint humbugs. \nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never \nbeen allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken \nanything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry \npiled his plate with a bit of everything except the humbugs and \nbegan to eat. It was all delicious. \n\u2018That does look good,\u2019 said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching \nHarry cut up his steak. \n\u2018Can\u2019t you \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018I haven\u2019t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\u2019 said the ghost. \u2018I \ndon\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve \nintroduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your \nservice. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u2019 \n\u2018I know who you are!\u2019 said Ron suddenly. \u2018My brothers told me \nabout you \u2013 you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u2019 \n\u2018I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \u2013\u2019 the \nghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \n\u2018Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u2019 \nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t \ngoing at all the way he wanted. \n\u2018Like this,\u2019 he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His \nwhole head swung off his neck and fell on to his shoulder as if it \nwas on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but \nnot done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on \ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back on to his \nneck, coughed and said, \u2018So \u2013 new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re \ngoing to help us win the House Championship this year? \nGryffindor have never gone so long without winning.

Three times a week they \nwent out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, \nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they \nlearnt how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and \nfound out what they were used for. \nEasily the most boring lesson was History of Magic, which was \nthe only class taught by a ghost.

All Neville cared \nabout was never going near the dog again. \nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she \nwas such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added  \nbonus.

Five points from Gryffindor.\u2019 \n\u2018He\u2019s just made that rule up,\u2019 Harry muttered angrily as Snape \nlimped away. \u2018Wonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u2019 \n\u2018Dunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u2019 said Ron bitterly. \n* \nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, \nRon and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was \nchecking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She  \nwould never let them copy (\u2018How will you learn?\u2019), but by asking \nher to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch through the Ages  back, \nto take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be \nafraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was \ngoing to ask Snape if he could have it. \n\u2018Rather you than me,\u2019 they said together, but Harry had an idea \nthat Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening. \nHe made his way down to the staff room and knocked. There \nwas no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He \npushed the door ajar and peered inside \u2013 and a horrible scene met \nhis eyes. \nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his \nrobes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. \nFilch was handing Snape bandages. \n\u2018Blasted thing,\u2019 Snape was saying. \u2018How are you supposed to \nkeep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u2019", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2265, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63d3b5e7-eef8-486b-abb3-bcaf1e42656e": {"__data__": {"id_": "63d3b5e7-eef8-486b-abb3-bcaf1e42656e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "1. harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-by-jk-rowling.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jinkettyee/Desktop/my_GitHub/great-things/RAG-webapp/docs/1. harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-by-jk-rowling.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1100526, "creation_date": "2025-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f16a5df-5e10-4bf7-aaef-8016aba430e7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "1. harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-by-jk-rowling.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jinkettyee/Desktop/my_GitHub/great-things/RAG-webapp/docs/1. harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-by-jk-rowling.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1100526, "creation_date": "2025-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-06"}, "hash": "62455facd81906ecd589bdd1c1e5b803873008b897b6b581e9700b48a1cffc83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Quidditch  135 \n \nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but \u2013 \n\u2018POTTER!\u2019 \nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes \nquickly to hide his leg.

The lamp looked as if it was \nfloating along in mid-air, and even though Harry could feel his \narm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. \nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. \nStepping carefully over the rope which separated these books  \nfrom the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters \nspelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had \nno title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly \nlike blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe \nhe was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering \nwas coming from the books, as though they knew someone was \nthere who shouldn\u2019t be. \nHe had to start somewhere. Setti ng the lamp down carefully on \nthe floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-\nlooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye.

Where were the others? \nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. \nMalfoy, Neville and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. \nMalfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed \nhim for a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \n\u2018We\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two \nwere makin\u2019.

They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into \nthe Forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow \nbecause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed \nto be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree,  \nas though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain \nclose by.

Harry, Ron and Hermione shiv-\nered slightly \u2013 the towering white chessmen had no faces. \n\u2018Now what do we do?\u2019 Harry whispered. \n\u2018It\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Ron. \u2018We\u2019ve got to play our way across \nthe room.\u2019 \nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \n\u2018How?\u2019 said Hermione nervously. \n\u2018I think,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018we\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u2019 \nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch \nthe knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse \npawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look \ndown at Ron. \n\u2018Do we \u2013 er \u2013 have to join you to get across?\u2019 \nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \n\u2018This wants thinking about \u2026\u2019 he said. \u2018I suppose we\u2019ve got to \ntake the place of three of the black pieces \u2026\u2019 \nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.

He wore \nround glasses, and on his forehe ad was a thin, lightning-shaped \nscar. \nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even \nfor a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\u2019s very mysterious \npast, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys\u2019 doorstep \neleven years before. \nAt the age of one, Harry had somehow survived a curse from \nthe greatest dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose \nname most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry\u2019s par-\nents had died in Voldemort\u2019s attack, but Harry had escaped with \nhis lightning scar, and somehow \u2013 nobody understood why \u2013 \nVoldemort\u2019s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to \nkill Harry . \nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\u2019s sister and \nher husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never \nunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without \nmeaning to, believing the Dursleys\u2019 story that he had got his scar \nin the car crash which had killed his parents. \nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry , \nand the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place \nat wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now \nthe school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for \nthe summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in \nsomething smelly . \nThe Dursleys hadn\u2019t even remembered that today happened to \nbe Harry\u2019s twelfth birthday . Of course, his hopes hadn\u2019t been high; \nthey\u2019d never given him a proper present, let alone a cake \u2013 but to \nignore it completely ...", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2338, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f619bac-eb73-4308-aa2a-be6d77afe6ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f619bac-eb73-4308-aa2a-be6d77afe6ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "2.

He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but \nhis month at The Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was \ndifficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the \nDursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he \nturned up in Privet Drive. \nOn their last evening, Mrs Weasley conjured up a sumptuous \ndinner which included all of Harry\u2019s favourite things, ending with \na mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off \nthe evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the \nkitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall \nfor at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot \nchocolate and bed. \nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They were up \nat cock-crow , but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal \nto do. Mrs Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare \nsocks and quills, people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed \nwith bits of toast in their hands, and Mr Weasley nearly broke his \nneck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying \nGinny\u2019s trunk to the car. \nHarry couldn\u2019t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls \nand a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia.

Ginny \nwas amongst them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley \nhair.

Harry well remembered \nputting it on, exactly one year ago,  and waiting, petrified, for its \ndecision as it muttered aloud in his ear.

He was in such a foul \ntemper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\u2019 \n\u2018There\u2019s something else,\u2019 said Harry , watching Hermione tearing \nbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \u2018Dobby \ncame to visit me in the middle of the night.\u2019 \nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them every-\nthing Dobby had told him \u2013 or hadn\u2019t told him. Ron and \nHermione listened with their mouths open. \n\u2018The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\u2019 said Hermione. \n\u2018This settles it,\u2019 said Ron in a triumphant voice. \u2018Lucius Malfoy \nmust\u2019ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and \nnow he\u2019s told dear old Draco how to do it. It\u2019s obvious. Wish \nDobby\u2019d told you what kind of monster\u2019s in there, though. I want \nto know how come nobody\u2019s noticed it sneaking round the school.\u2019 \n\u2018Maybe it can make itself invi sible,\u2019 said Hermione, prodding \nleeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \u2018Or maybe it can disguise \nitself \u2013 pretend to be a suit of armour or something. I\u2019ve read \nabout Chameleon Ghouls ...\u2019 \n\u2018You read too much, Hermione,\u2019 said Ron, pouring dead \nlacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty \nlacewing bag and looked round at Harry . \n\u2018So Dobby stopped us getting on the train and broke your \narm ...\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018You know what, Harry?

It opened silently and they \nentered. Professor McGonagall told  Harry to wait, and left him \nthere, alone. \nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers\u2019 \noffices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\u2019s was by far \nthe most interesting. If he hadn\u2019 t been scared out of his wits that \nhe was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very \npleased to have a chance to look around it. \nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little \nnoises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-\nlegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The \nwalls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and head-\nmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. \nThere was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a \nshelf behind it, a shabby , tattered wizard\u2019s hat \u2013 the Sorting Hat. \nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches \nand wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn\u2019t hurt if he took the Hat \ndown and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had \nput him in the right house. \nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the Hat from its shelf, \nand lowered it slowly onto his head.

Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his \nvoice. \n\u2018Sorry I disturbed you, I\u2019ll go now ,\u2019 he half-shouted. \nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked \npast Harry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains \nat his window . \nThe sky outside the window was ruby red; it seemed to be sun-\nset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down and twiddled his \nthumbs, watching the door. \nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix; no \nwhirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had \nknown it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, \nnot Dumbledore, and he, Harry , was little more than a phantom, \ncompletely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. \nThere was a knock on the office door. \n\u2018Enter,\u2019 said the old wizard in a feeble voice. \nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A sil-\nver Prefect\u2019s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller \nthan Harry , but he, too, had jet-black hair. \n\u2018Ah, Riddle,\u2019 said the Headmaster. \n\u2018You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\u2019 said Riddle. He \nlooked nervous. \n\u2018Sit down,\u2019 said Dippet. \u2018I\u2019ve just been reading the letter you \nsent me.\u2019 \n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very \ntightly . \n\u2018My dear boy ,\u2019 said Dippet kindly , \u2018I cannot possibly let you stay \nat school over the summer.

And if, as a boy , \nHagrid had heard that a monste r was hidden somewhere in the \ncastle, Harry was sure he\u2019d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse \nof it. He\u2019d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had \nbeen cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to \nstretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-\nold Hagrid trying to fit a lead and collar on it. But he was equally \ncertain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody . \nHarry half-wished he hadn\u2019t found out how to work Riddle\u2019s \ndiary .

They \nwent to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean and \nSeamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally \nfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the Cloak \nover themselves. \nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors \nwasn\u2019t enjoyable. Harry , who had wandered the castle at night \nseveral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. \nTeachers, Prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in \npairs, staring around for any unusual activity . Their Invisibility \nCloak didn\u2019t stop them making any noise, and there was a par-\nticularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from \nthe spot where Snape was standing guard. Thankfully , Snape \nsneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with \nrelief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. \nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried towards the lighted \nwindows of Hagrid\u2019s house, and pulled off the Cloak only when \nthey were right outside his front door. \nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They \nfound themselves face to face, with him aiming a crossbow at \nthem, Fang the boarhound barking loudly behind him. \n\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \n\u2018What\u2019re you two doin\u2019 here?\u2019 \n\u2018What\u2019s that for?\u2019 said Harry , pointing at the crossbow as they \nstepped inside. \n\u2018Nothin\u2019 ... nothin\u2019,\u2019 Hagrid muttered. \u2018I\u2019ve bin expectin\u2019 ... \ndoesn\u2019 matter ...

But with no Hagrid visible \nfrom the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his \nheels, the scene didn\u2019t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than \nthe inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. \nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were \nnow barred from the hospital wing. \n\u2018We\u2019re taking no more chances,\u2019 Madam Pomfrey told them \nseverely through a crack in the hospital door. \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry , \nthere\u2019s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these \npeople off ...\u2019 \nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that \nthe sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the \nmullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the \nschool that didn\u2019t look worried and tense, and any laughter that \nrang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was \nquickly stifled. \nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore\u2019s final words to himself. \n\u2018I will only truly have left this sch ool when none here are loyal to me \n... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\u2019 But \nwhat good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to \nask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as \nthey were? \nHagrid\u2019s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand \u2013 \nthe trouble was, there didn\u2019t seem to be a single spider left in the \ncastle to follow .

At last they reached the \nsafety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned \nitself into glowing ash. They took off the Cloak and climbed the \nwinding staircase to their dormitory . \nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. \nHarry , however, didn\u2019t feel very sleepy . He sat on the edge of his \nfour-poster, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. \nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he \nthought, sounded like a sort of  monster Voldemort \u2013 even other \nmonsters didn\u2019t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to \nfinding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even \nHagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. \nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against \nhis pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower \nwindow. \nHe couldn\u2019t see what else they could do.

Harry flung \nhis arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake \nskin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling which were \nthundering to the floor. Next mo ment, he was standing alone, \ngazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \n\u2018Ron!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Are you OK? Ron!\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m here!\u2019 came Ron\u2019s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \n\u2018I\u2019m OK.
