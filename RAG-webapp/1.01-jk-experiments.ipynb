    "### Integrating better reasoning and inferencing capabilities\n",
    "While a RAG only chat-engine might be able to answer simple user questions like factual, closed-sourced ones. However, when the questions involves reasoning and inferencing abilities, it might not return good answers. The Harry Potter series is a great example where often, the reader has to make inferences from various parts of the book to be able to come to conclusions (like whether Severus Snape was cursing Harry at his first quidditch match?). System is not robust enough yet to be able to \"answer with thought\". Some examples: \n",
    "- When asked about what happened at the Burrow, it answered well but not coherently, mixing up event sequence.\n",
    "- When asked about first quidditch game, it retrieved information about the 2nd quidditch game instead. \n",
    "- **Potential solution:** Increase no. of retrieved docs, refine prompt template, incorporate \"consult\" with the internet (web-search tool). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated comments: \n",
    "- When context window is updated with chat history, it tends to get sequencing wrong (Burrow question). Performance was good if chat history was not updated. \n",
    "- **[Conclusions?]** No issues with retrieved context. Update prompt to selectively use or not use chat history based on user query. \n",
    "- Based on retrieved context, generator LM was not able to update it's response based on sequence of events in the story (Eg. Snape's intentions was good even though it was portrayed as bad in the first quidditch game.)\n",
    "- **[Solutions?]** Cover up and fact-check with latest updated version from web-search? RAG system is really good with factual retrieval but time series/storyline inference? Not that fantastic. Note that as RAG solves the \"training data\" backlog problem, would not be recommended to allow RAG to answer out of context, hence, web-search. \n",
    "- **[Further thoughts]** What if the database is firewalled? How could we improve the reasoning capabilities of the language model? First, check retrieval*. \n",
    "- **[Findings]** Retrieval missed crucial \"turn of tale\" information in the last chapter. **Conclusions: Add section on BM25 hybrid retriever and supplementing context with web-search capabilities*\n",
    "- **[Concluding thoughts]** Even for restricted use-cases with contextualized query data sources, we can utilize web-search to supplement context window with a hypothetical answer to cross-check original answer structure. "
