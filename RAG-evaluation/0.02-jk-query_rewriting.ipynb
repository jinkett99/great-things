    "### Implementing Query Re-writing strategy (Sub-query decomposition) + Retrieval Methodology (Hypothetical Document Embeddings - HyDE)\n",
    "In this section, we aim to **improve document retrieval capabilities** of our RAG system (Research Assistant v2) through (1) Sub-query decomposition and (2) HyDE methodology. More information of these methodologies below. Future works would include RAFT (retrieval augmented fine-tuning) to tackle the answer generation phase of our answer generator LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Query re-writing and HyDE**\n",
    "Under the context of query re-writing to optimise query retrieval and answer quality in RAG systems, Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) and Query Decomposition are techniques that tackle different fronts with an external LLM. HyDE aims to improve retrieval “accuracy” through generated and embedded “hypothetical documents” to answer user queries. These hypothetical documents are then used in retrieving real documents from the vector store via doc-doc similarity search to produce more “relevant” matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Query Decomposition aims to improve answer quality from complex queries. The process breaks down complex queries/questions into smaller sub-questions/problems, which can either be solved sequentially (use first answer + retrieval for 2nd to answer 2nd question) or in parallel (consolidate each answer separately to form final answer).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other query transformation techniques to tackle various “human-centric” limitations with user queries include multi-query (to tackle query ambiguity) and step-back (when a higher-level conceptual understanding is required for accurate retrieval)."

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;90;149;237m[docs] A: Based on the provided context information, it can be inferred that Snape's role as a double agent influenced his interactions with Harry in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Motivation**: As a double agent, Snape's primary motivation was to protect Harry from the Dark Lord Voldemort and ensure his own safety.\n",
      "2. **Information sharing**: Although Snape did not reveal much about himself or his intentions, he provided information that helped Harry in various ways, such as suggesting decoys for Polyjuice Potion (Chapter 33) and giving Dumbledore crucial information about Quirrell's involvement with Voldemort (The Prince's Tale).\n",
      "3. **Trust**: Snape showed trust in Harry by confiding in him and sharing sensitive information that would put Harry's life at risk.\n",
      "4. **Consequences of actions**: Snape's double agent role led to consequences for himself, such as being forced to keep a close eye on Harry (Chapter 33) and potentially betraying the Order of the Phoenix if he didn't comply with Dumbledore's demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Snape's role as a double agent significantly impacted his interactions with Harry, putting Harry in harm's way while also testing the loyalty and trustworthiness of both characters.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;237;90;200m[docs] A: Based on the provided context information, it can be inferred that Snape's past experiences shaped his decisions to protect Harry in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Loyalty to Lily and her family**: Although Snape is revealed to have a complicated history with Lily Evans Potter (Harry's mother), it is mentioned that he was watching over her for her protection throughout the years. This suggests that Snape took her well-being seriously, which likely led him to prioritize Harry's safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dumbledore's guidance and trust**: Dumbledore appears to have trusted Snape enough to involve him in critical decisions, such as keeping Potter safe from Lord Voldemort. This level of trust might be rooted in their shared goal of preventing the Dark Lord's harm to multiple individuals, including Potter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Snape's feelings towards Lily and her son**: The scene where Snape is visibly upset by the mention of Lily and Harry's connection (the \"parasitic growth\") suggests that he has strong emotions attached to these relationships. This could indicate a deep sense of responsibility or guilt associated with protecting them, possibly stemming from past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Snape's desire for protection**: Throughout the story, Snape seems to be driven by a desire to protect those close to him, including Lily and Harry. His actions in the present scene, such as slumping forward in pain, imply that this desire is rooted in his personal history and experiences of loss or hardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Snape's conflicted loyalties**: The fact that Snape becomes enraged when Dumbledore suggests the idea of Voldemort sparing Harry raises questions about his true loyalties. His actions suggest that he may be torn between protecting those he cares about (Lily, Harry) and carrying out a higher moral obligation to protect others from harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors collectively suggest that Snape's past experiences have significantly shaped his decisions to protect Harry, driven by a complex interplay of loyalty, personal connections, guilt, and conflicting loyalties.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;11;159;203m[docs] A: Snape provided information about Voldemort's plans to create a false trail by using a Confundus Charm on Auror Dawlish. This involved placing a plan in place to lead Potter away from being moved until the night before his seventeenth birthday, when he would turn thirteen and be protected from death.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;155;135;227m[docs] A: Snape used several strategies to conceal his true allegiance from Voldemort. Firstly, he pretended to have suggested a plan using Polyjuice Potion to create decoys, which was actually a ruse to gain information about the Order of the Phoenix's plans and help protect Harry. He also pretended to be acting out a scenario as Severus Snape with Mundungus Fletcher in an unfamiliar tavern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Snape manipulated events by positioning himself between Voldemort and the Order of the Phoenix, creating a false sense of security around Harry while he secretly worked on a plan to deceive Voldemort about the departure date from Hogwarts. By presenting Polyjuice Potion as his own idea to the Order of the Phoenix, Snape concealed his true role in planning the decoy strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Snape used his cunning and intelligence to mislead Dumbledore's orders, pretending not to have known about the detention schedule with Harry and instead creating a situation where Harry would be left alone. This deception helped conceal Snape's allegiance from Voldemort and allowed him to continue working on a plan that would ultimately benefit Harry and thwart Voldemort's plans.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;237;90;200m[docs] A: Based on the provided context information, it appears that Lily Potter's survival was a turning point for her son. Despite being shot in the head with a killing curse by Lord Voldemort, which would have killed him instantly, he survived due in part to Snape's actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is revealed that when Snape arrived at the scene of the crime, Dumbledore opened his eyes and said \"You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\" indicating that Snape had done something to prevent Harry from meeting his death. Additionally, it is mentioned that Snape's behavior changed after the time at Hogwarts, where he seemed to lose his patience with certain individuals, including James Potter (Lily's brother).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite this change in behavior towards others, the question specifically asks about Snape's actions to support Harry throughout the series. Considering the context, it can be inferred that Snape:\n",

      "2. Faced down a group of Death Eaters who were attempting to kill James Potter.\n",
      "3. Demonstrated concern for Harry's well-being when he was arguing with James about their friendship.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Data Volume**: The dataset is quite large, with 4 million images across all categories. This suggests that the project requires significant processing power and computational resources to handle such a massive dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Image Variety**: There are approximately 1500 unique classes in the dataset, indicating a wide range of image types (e.g., objects, scenes, actions). This diversity can help improve the model's performance on various tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Class Balance**: The dataset has an imbalanced distribution, with some classes having significantly more instances than others. For example, there are 5000 instances for Class \"Object\" and only a few hundred instances for other classes. This could lead to biased training data if not addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data Format**: The dataset is in the format of images (JPEG) stored in a directory hierarchy (`/Users/jinkettyee/Desktop/my_GitHub/great-things/RAG-evaluation/../RAG-webscraper/docs/...`), indicating that the images are organized in a hierarchical structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: The dataset includes metrics such as accuracy (~20% for ResNet50, ~60% for ViT-16) and quantization accuracy (~90%) after post-training quantization. These results suggest that the model's performance can be improved with proper tuning and data preprocessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Deployment Complexity**: The deployment workflow involves multiple steps, including building, deploying to staging, approving production deployment, and updating stacks in CloudFormation. This complexity may indicate that the project requires a robust and scalable architecture for efficient deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Security and Reliability Considerations**: The deployment workflow includes manual checks (e.g., approve production deployment) to prevent automatic deployment into production environment. This suggests that security and reliability considerations are crucial to ensure the model is deployed securely and reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Model Compression**: The post-training quantization process reduces precision of weights, allowing for compression while maintaining similar performance. However, this also leads to accuracy degradation.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;155;135;227m[docs] A: Online platforms face several challenges when implementing effective content moderation. Some of these challenges include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Quality and Quantity**: The amount and variety of images or videos being uploaded to social media platforms can be overwhelming, making it difficult to obtain a diverse dataset for training machine learning models.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Balancing False Positives and Negatives**: Content moderators must balance the need to prevent explicit nudity with the risk of false positives (incorrectly labeling harmless content as NSFW) or negatives (missing explicit nudity in otherwise safe content).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adversarial Attacks**: Users may intentionally provide inaccurate feedback or submit images designed to mislead the model, which can degrade performance over time and lead to an increase in misclassifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Privacy and Consent Concerns**: The use of user images for model training raises significant ethical concerns, primarily revolving around privacy and consent. Online platforms must address these concerns through stringent data handling and usage policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Scalability and Real-Time Performance**: As the volume of content increases, online platforms must ensure that their content moderation systems can scale up to handle real-time inference, while maintaining responsiveness and a seamless user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Addressing Diverse Content Formats**: Expanding the project scope to handle different types of media formats (e.g., GIFs, videos) would increase the system's overall effectiveness but also introduce additional complexities in integrating detection techniques and algorithms for each format.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Monitoring Metrics and Thresholds**: Online platforms must closely monitor key performance metrics like Model Prediction Latency and set realistic thresholds that account for typical usage patterns while also ensuring they can react swiftly to potential issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Dealing with Adversarial Attacks**: Implementing robust verification processes for user feedback and deploying defenses against adversarial attacks is crucial to mitigate the risk of model degradation over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Ensuring Data Anonymization and Protection**: Online platforms must ensure that user images are anonymized and protected from unauthorized access, while also limiting data sharing with third parties.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Data bias**: Amazon Rekognition is a machine learning service that uses pre-trained models to classify images and videos as either safe or not safe. However, this can lead to biased results if the training data does not accurately represent diverse communities, leading to inaccurate classifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Limited contextual understanding**: While Amazon Rekognition provides detailed labels for individual images, it may not provide sufficient context about the image's relevance to social media content moderation. For example, a single label might not capture nuanced differences between NSFW and non-NSFW content.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Class imbalance**: As mentioned earlier, class imbalance can occur in content moderation datasets, leading to difficulties in achieving high accuracy rates. Amazon Rekognition is only able to handle one type of classification (e.g., safe or not safe), which may lead to overfitting when trying to adapt to different types of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lack of explainability**: While Amazon Rekognition provides some level of model explanation, the results can be complex and difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency can make it challenging for moderators to understand why certain images are being flagged or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dependence on labeling quality**: The accuracy of content moderation depends heavily on the quality of the labels provided by Amazon Rekognition. Inaccurate or incomplete labeling can lead to poor performance and increased false positives or negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Limited scalability**: As the volume of social media content grows, the need for scalable solutions increases. Amazon Rekognition may not be able to handle very large datasets without significant computational resources or infrastructure.\n",
